# Tyil's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. It is my life. I must master them as I must
master my life.

My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless. I must
place my dotfiles in the proper directory.  I must rice them better than my
colleagues, who are trying to out-rice me. I must compile stuff before they do.

My dotfiles and I know that what counts during compilation is not the
optimisation, the -j count used or the USEflags that are set. I know that it is
the final binary that counts.

My dotfiles are human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will write
them as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its
accessories, its sights and its values. I will keep my dotfiles clean and
ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of eachother.

Before Stallman, I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of my
system. We are the masters of our applications. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is mine and there are no unconfigured applications, but
true rice!
